## MFA-REACT

This is a sample application that shows how to [implement multi-factor authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/multifactor-authentication-in-your-react-apps) in your React applications. I use it for educational purposes to find security logic flaws in MFA primarily in Auth0. I have the same template for Duo and other MFA services.
## Installation

* 1. Clone this github repo
* 2. Run `npm install` to install all the required node modules
* 3. Open up `src/views/Main/routes.js` and replace the placeholders `_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID_` and `_AUTH0_DOMAIN_` with real values from your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/).
* 4. Run `npm start` and proceed!
